## About the project
 
  This is a project for Udacity Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree Schoolarship. The students are given a starter project that has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game. Students have to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file and according to the project instructions.
  
## Instructions

The game board consists of sixteen "cards" arranged in a grid. The deck is made up of eight different pairs of cards, each with different symbols on one side. The cards are arranged randomly on the grid with the symbol face down. The gameplay rules are very simple: 
 1. The player flips one card over to reveal its underlying symbol.
 2. The player then turns over a second card, trying to find the corresponding card with the same symbol.
 3. If the cards match, both cards stay flipped over.
 4. If the cards do not match, both cards are flipped face down.
 5. The game ends once all cards have been correctly matched.

At the end of the game the player recives a message that tells him the time and moves number nedded to finish the game. The player also recives a star rating.

The moves and stars count system:
  - The moves are increased by 1 each time 2 cards are turned
  - Star rating criteria: 3 stars for max 10 moves, 2 stars for 11-15 moves, 1 star for 16-20 moves, no star for more than 20 moves
